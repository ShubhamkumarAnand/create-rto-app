# Create RTO App (Remix + Tailwind + Prisma + SQLite)

**Create RTO App** is a starter template for building full-stack web applications using the Remix framework, Tailwind CSS for styling, Prisma as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool, and SQLite as the database. This template is designed to help you kickstart your web development projects with these modern and powerful technologies.

## Features

- **[Remix Framework](https://remix.run/):** Remix is a versatile framework for building web applications. It provides server-rendered React and has features like routing, data loading, and code splitting built in.

- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/):** Tailwind CSS is a highly customizable CSS framework that makes styling and designing your application a breeze. It comes with utility classes to help you quickly build responsive and beautifully styled user interfaces.

- **[Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/):** Prisma is a modern database toolkit that simplifies database access in your application. It supports various databases, and in this template, we use SQLite for easy setup and development.

- **[Shadcn/Ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/):** Beautifully designed components that you can copy and paste into your apps. Accessible. Customizable. Open Source.

- **[SQL Lite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html):** SQLite is a software library that implements a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine. SQLite is the most widely deployed SQL database engine in the world.
